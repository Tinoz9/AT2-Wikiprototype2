ArrayArrayLinear}an array is a collection of elements that is indexed, and mutable. Each element of an array can be referred to but its index.Binary Search TreeTree
Non-LinearπA binary search tree is an ordered tree comprising of nodes. The tree is ordered by the child nodes on the left must be less than the parent and the nodes on the right must be greater. GrapgGraphs
Non-LinearzGraphs are made of edges and nodes. Any number of edges can connect to a node. It is a good way to represent information. 
Hash TableHash
Non-Linear£In a hash table an array is used as a storage medium an associative index is generated using has technique making accessing the data very quick regardless of size.HeapTree
Non-Linear∆A heap data structure is when a complete binary tree satisfies the heap property. A heap can then be created a heap is when the child properties are compared and ordered in a new tree called a heap.Linked ListListLinearÕA Linked list is, rather than referred to by their position in memory, point to the next element in the list. Linked lists are a composition of data fields and a reference to the next element called nodes.ListListLinearèList is an efficient way to store a collection of data. It can store different datatypes in the same list and data can be referred to by index.QueueAbstractLinearõA linear data structure where data that is entered first pushes to the front. The additions are made at one side of the queue and deletions from the other.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-Linear¢Is a datatype organises data in a hierarchical structure consisting of parents, child‚Äôs and subtrees. It will keep the height of the tree as small as possible. SetAbstract
Non-LinearâUsed to store any number of unique values of the same data type in any order you wish. The value itself is the key to accessing the data.StackAbstractLineartA stack is a data structure where data this is entered first is the last to be processed, the opposite is also true.Two-Dimension ArrayArrayLinearüA two-dimensional array sometimes referred to as a matrix, is a datatype where elements are organised into rows and columns and are referred to by two indexes.
